## About me
Hello, I am a freshman M.S. student at SKKU (Sungkyunkwan University) majoring in Immersive Media Engineering. I firmly believe that the future of AI should not only focus on single modality but also embrace a multi-modal approach by integrating complementary data types. This conviction is why I am deeply interested in multi-modal research, exploring how these diverse data dimensions can synergistically enhance the power of AI to tackle real-world scenarios. Additionally, I am intrigued by parameter-efficient learning, recognizing its critical role in developing more scalable, sustainable, and secure AI models.
